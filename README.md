# intro-to-python-numpy-matplotlib

## Topics Covered:
**Data Types:**

* **Int, Float, Boolean:** Basic operations (e.g., comparisons, arithmetic).
* **Strings:** Formatting, slicing, type conversion, and useful string methods (e.g., upper(), replace(), split()).
* **Containers:** Lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples. Includes indexing, modification, and comprehension.
  
**Control Structures:**

* **If-Else:** Conditional logic with operators (==, !=, etc.).
* **Loops:** For and while loops, range, enumerate, and list comprehensions.

**Functions and Classes:**

* Function creation, arguments, and examples.
* Class definitions, constructors, and methods.
  
**Numpy:**

* **Arrays:** Creating and manipulating arrays (np.array, np.zeros, np.ones).
* **Indexing & Slicing:** Accessing and modifying array elements.
* **Array Math:** Elementwise operations, broadcasting, dot products, and matrix multiplication.
* **Advanced Numpy:** Boolean indexing, reshaping, and broadcasting examples

**Matplotlib:** A library used for creating static and interactive visualizations (e.g., plotting 2D data and multiple lines in a graph).
